## Simple Summary

The Abax Lending Protocol is a decentralized platform designed to enable secure, peer-to-contract lending and borrowing of cryptocurrencies. This proposal outlines the deployment strategy on the Aleph Zero mainnet, leveraging innovative risk and interest rate models to optimize capital efficiency and provide competitive interest rates.

## Motivation

The current DeFi landscape on Aleph Zero lacks a robust lending protocol that offers efficient capital utilization and high security. Existing protocols do not fully address the needs of both depositors seeking higher returns and borrowers looking for low-cost loans. The Abax Lending Protocol aims to fill this gap by providing a more efficient, user-friendly, and secure platform for decentralized lending.

## Specification

The Abax Lending Protocol will implement the following features:
- **Collateral Risk Management Model**: An advanced model to optimize collateral usage, reducing the risk for both lenders and borrowers.
- **Interest Rate Model**: A dynamic model that adjusts interest rates based on market conditions, ensuring fair returns for depositors and affordable rates for borrowers.
- **Smart Contracts**: Deployed on the Aleph Zero blockchain, these contracts facilitate the lending and borrowing process, including the handling of collateral, interest calculations, and liquidations.
- **Supported Assets**: Initially, the protocol will support major cryptocurrencies such as BTC, ETH, and the native AZERO token, with plans to expand to other assets.
